# crouching-seo-hidden-accessibility

This is a refactor of a broken webpage, needed SEO, and a webpage that was not up to accessibility standards. Links did not work correctly, and it was generally a hard to read page, and hard to read code. No comments, unnecessary CSS classes, and barely any semantic tags inspired me to swoop in, rescue this webpage from the depths of the internet, and bring it to the front pages of Google. 

## The Original Page

## Fixes

- Added text shadows and a hover condition to header links to make them standout
- Added a border between header and splash image, as well as around the elements in the main section and around the aside.
- Changed the selection color to one that stands out
- Added circular borders around images in aside
- Changed all div tags to semantic tags
- Consolidated CSS code
- Added comments throughout to organize code better
- Made the company logo a link to the homepage
- Changed font in main sections to bigger, easier to read fonts
